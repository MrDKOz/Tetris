# Tetris
[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) is a well known game where pieces called "tetrominos" fall from the top of the screen, and your job is to stack them in such a way that you fill a full row with pieces of the tetrominos, you cannot slow down the piece as it falls, but you can rotate it to better fit the pieces you have already placed to form a full row.

This project is a C# implementation of the game that I created as a portfolio piece, it is built in [WinForms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms), while this is not the *ideal* platform for a game, the focus of this piece is merely the code that powers the game (it's still enjoyable!).

**Grid**
The grid on which the game takes place has the standard dimensions (10 x 20). The pieces cannot leave this grid.

**Pieces (Tetrominos)**
There are 7 standard pieces in the game Tetris.

*I will update this ReadMe with explanations of the approaches I take to various design decisions I make throughout the development process.*
